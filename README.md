The sole reason for the existence of this is that hyprsome didn't work for me as I expected it for the first try and I copied and modified that. This is not my code, except for the junk in the main file, and I am proud of it. It works. It is fine.

Note that currently it only works on my setup: [monitor 1]  [monitor 0]  [monitor 2]

I will fix it either uppon demand or out of boredom (it will probably never be fixed).
