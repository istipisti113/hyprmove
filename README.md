The sole reason for the existence of this is that hyprsome didn't work for me as I expected it for the first try and I copied and modified that. This is not my code, except for the junk in the main file, and I am proud of it. It works. It is fine.

It should support any monitor arrangement now, it will decide the order based on the x coordinates of the screens. A possible limitation is that it will assume that you have either 10 workspaces per monitor or less, but the eleventh one is always on the next monitor.

I will fix it either uppon demand or out of boredom (it will probably never be fixed).
